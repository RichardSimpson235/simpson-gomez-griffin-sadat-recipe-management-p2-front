# Toastr

Toastr is a web application for managing user created recipes. Users are able to manage their accounts and recipes through a responsive UI. They have an account page where they manage their account information and a recipe page where they manage their recipes. They can also access other users' recipes for viewing, commenting, liking and disliking; through a search page which allows them to search for recipes by name. Admin users have the ability to ban users and approve recipes, and recipes are not viewable until they have been approved. Recipes contain a variety of information, including media, a set of instructions, and a set of ingredients. Toastr also makes use of the spoonacular api to display extra information about each ingredient.

## Getting Started

Make sure you first set up the Spring backend that referenced this repository. Once that is set up, clone this repository with:

```
https://github.com/RichardSimpson235/simpson-gomez-griffin-sadat-recipe-management-p3-front.git
```

Navigate to the app folder (titled toastr) and in the app folder run:
```
npm install
```

This will create the node_modules folder that has all of the dependencies from then package.json file. After that finishes downloading just run
```
npm start
```

while in the toastr folder and you're ready to go!

## Usage
To use the app open a browser window to http://localhost:3000/ and navigate the UI as you see fit. Both the frontend node server and backend spring application must be running at the same time, so don't forget to do that!
